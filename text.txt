so once when I was 4 I was sleeping over at my grandparents house and I was sleeping in the guest room
basically I woke up at like 3am needing to talk to my grandparents (because I was 4 and scared of the dark)
and the way the room was laid out was that there was a mirror next to the bed, a door at the left end of the room
and a table next to the mirror. basically when I was trying to go to the door and the mirror was in such a way where
the door was reflected perfectly (the door was open so I could see outside of it) and so I'd tried to walk through the mirror rather than the door
and also squeeze between a really small gap through the table. Once admitting defeat after not being able to walk through the mirror
I laid back on the bed on the wrong end and fell off and cried and only then did my grandparents come in to see me on the floor crying.
